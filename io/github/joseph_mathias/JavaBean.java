// A JavaBean is just a standard
// All properties are private (use getters/setters)
// A public no-argument constructor
// Implements Serializable.
// That's it. It's just a convention. Lots of libraries depend on it though.
// With respect to Serializable, from the API documentation:
//     Serializability of a class is enabled by the class implementing the java.io.Serializable interface. 
//     Classes that do not implement this interface will not have any of their state serialized or deserialized. 
//     All subtypes of a serializable class are themselves serializable. 
//     The serialization interface has no methods or fields and serves only to identify the semantics of being serializable.

public class JavaBean {
